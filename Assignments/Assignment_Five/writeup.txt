Text Analytics Assignment 5

1) I used the Ruby library Nokogiri to scrape the data from Wikipedia.
For each country, Wikipedia uses some combination of nothing, bold, or italics.
The countries in only bold are UN member states.
Those are the countries I decided to include.
This also includes the Vatican, which I guess has a special UN designation.
So this gave me 194 countries.
For each country, I took the first listed capital.
In every case, this was listed as either the official or the administrative seat, so I figured it was ok for this assignment.
So, I also had 194 capitals.
I wrote this to a CSV file which had five fields for continent, country, capital, country_text, and capital_text.
Antarctica does not have any UN member states.

I used the Java implementation of Lucene to index them.

b)

Number of hits: 4
London
Cairo
Prague
Washington, D.C.

c)
Phrase "located below sea level"
Number of hits: 1
Baku

A quick Google search revealed that Baku and Amsterdam are the two capitals below sea level.
A closer inspection of Amsterdam's wiki page shows that it says "situated...below sea level"
So, the phrase query "located below sea level" did not return Amsterdam.
If we use the phrase query "situated below sea level" we get Amsterdam, but not Baku.
But this is okay.

3.1) I first counted the number of unique terms in the corpus, and got 51,493.
Then, for each continent I created a term frequency vector, and found the sum of all terms.
I used these two numbers to compute the mutual information score for each term in the term frequency vector.

3.2)
This table is in the file term_matrix.xlsx
Terms are listed from low to high.
So, "city" had the highest score for five of the six continents.

3.3)
This is also in the term_matrix.xlsx file.
There are 66 unique terms (out of the 180).

3.4)
I used the stuff-classifier Ruby gem.

3.5)
The confusion matrix is in the confusion_matrix.xlsx file.
The tool was unable to classify Tunis and Mogadishu, returning nil values for those two capitals.
Otherwise, it correctly classified 137 of the 194 capitals (70.6%).
It did very poorly on African cities, classifying 44 of 52 into Europe.
Perhaps this is because of Europe's extensive colonization of Africa?

3.6)
I tried a few cities.
Cambridge, MA and Evanston, IL were both incorrectly classified to Europe.
New York City was correctly assigned North America.
Hong Kong was correctly assigned Asia.
Punta del Este, Uruguay, was correctly assigned South America.

If I understand the documentation correctly, the probabilities for Cambridge are:
[[:europe, 2.0147277279772495e+184],
 [:north_america, 1.3362883964012914e-104],
 [:asia, 8.95431085008665e-165],
 [:south_america, 6.8289618001197145e-205],
 [:africa, 0.0],
 [:oceania, 0.0]]
Obviously these are not probabilities.
But, we can look at them as relative, and see that they are listed in descending order.
The documentation for this tool is not very good.
