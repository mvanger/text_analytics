Edit: I was confused about the TF matrix, and built it summing across documents for each (resulting in an n x 1 vector, rather than n x 42). Unfortunately I didn't have time to fix it.
This uses the StandardAnalyzer:
Term Frequency Top 10:
i=485
my=191
analytics=181
text=158
data=118
from=78
have=73
am=67
more=57
class=55

TF-IDF (using Math.log10()) Top 10:
Ã¢=2.0376202031649364
her=1.7749771702715547
she=1.6907926843903092
maintenance=1.371804793769799
shawna=1.371804793769799
michigan=1.371804793769799
his=1.2787536009528289
video=1.2631334650074886
words=1.2483122772269866
game=1.2368798816733575

Top 10 T from my bio:
i=11
text=4
analytics=4
very=2
am=2
still=2
find=2
york=2
from=2
one=2

If k = 1, the T summary is {i}
If k = 3, the T summary is {i, text, analytics}
If k = 5, the T summary is {i, text, analytics, very, am}
And if k = 10, the T summary is {i, text, analytics, very, am, still, find, york, from, one}
Although, terms from position 4 onwards to 28 all have a frequency of 2, so those could just as easily be replaced. This does not seem very good! Let's try it using the matrix M:
his=1.2787536009528289
enjoy=0.9404713064930467
credit=0.9241916261733354
reviews=0.8800789171124
perhaps=0.8450980400142568
still=0.8155715246051087
healthcare=0.8155715246051087
coming=0.8155715246051087
reading=0.810361020096253
enjoyed=0.810361020096253

If k = 1, the M summary is {his}
If k = 3, the M summary is {his, enjoy, credit}
If k = 5, the M summary is {his, enjoy, credit, reviews, perhaps}
If k = 10, the M summary is {his, enjoy, credit, reviews, perhaps, still, healthcare, coming, reading, enjoyed}
So, we see that most notably "text" and "analytics" have dropped out, since they are very popular in this corpus. This should be okay since we know, as a user, that all of the documents are about text analytics. So the M matrix one is more interesting. It also contains fewer popular, but boring, words such as very, am, and from. I think k = 5 is a reasonable selection. It lets us know the document talks about a man ("his"), and presumably this man "enjoys" things. Possibly things he enjoys include "credit", "reviews", and uncertainty ("perhaps"). A closer look at the document reveals that he actually dislikes credit! So perhaps this is not the best means of summarization.
